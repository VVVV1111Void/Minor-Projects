# About
A collection of minor scripts and CLI tools that I've created while trying out and learning new programming languages.
# Usage
## Python
Each python codebase should have their own respective READMEs. Please read them for usage.

## Rust
CD into the codebase of interest then cargo run.

# Contributions
Suggestions for code quality are welcome, as they are important for me to learn things.
